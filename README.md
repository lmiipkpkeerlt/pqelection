# requirements
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [gRPC Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/)
- [python](https://www.python.org)
- [openSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

# TODO
- fix TLS CA file flag errors when using `run.py`
- implement gnark
- logging
- currently the election authorities generate and distribute private parameters,
  what if bulletinboard/tallier/votingserver generated their own keypairs?
- hash commitment scheme? something collision resistant (currently SHA-512)
- anonymous channel for voter authentication?
- threshold signatures for the digital signature scheme (a set of n parties
  interactively generate a t-out-of-n secret sharing of the key, an interactive
  protocol is also used in signing algorithm)
- proper tallying phase
- tests
- Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm?
- mechanism to reject registrar if it is behaving dishonestly
- document trust assumptions, security properties, cryptographic preliminaries
- performance analysis 
- ZK things in existing voting technology?
- Possible alternatives to gnark: zcash and halo2?
- election authority as bootstrapping node / service registry
- voter interactive mode?
